Description: This project is a local, single-player game. The player controls a rocket that can move up, down, left, or right to avoid incoming asteroids. As well, the player can press the spacebar which shoots a laser that destroys all asteroids in its path. One point is awarded for each asteroid destroyed. The more asteroids destroyed, the more that will be created. Asteroids that collide with the rocket will deal damage and the game concludes when all health is lost.
